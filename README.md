# Bookmark Site Builder

The mission is to build an entire site from a sub folder in your chorme bookmarks

The builder allows for:
- custom named links/pages
- custom timestamps and sorting
- custom tags
- screen shots of the page stored into s3 by date
  - allow multiple to show site changes

Later:
- a management of tags and some other stuff that alters into the bookmarks file
- Site puzzler that allows for people to make their own news cases with citations
